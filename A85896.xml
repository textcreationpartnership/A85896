            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Church hath been under a threefold oppreſſion; firſt violent, under perſecuting Emperours. <hi>2.</hi> Fraudulent, under inſinuating Hereticks: <hi>3.</hi> Violent and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent both, under the Romiſh Antichriſt; every one worſe then other. This laſt the moſt pernicious and perillous as in whom the force and fraude of both the former were combined in one. The firſt was grievous to the body, but could not touch the ſoule; the ſecond deſtroyed the ſoule, though it ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the body; the third ſpared neither: but by Impoſtures, lies and a thouſand falſhoods entangled the ſoule in damnable errours; and upon the bodies of Chriſtians, what ſavage cruelties they have exerciſed is as incredible to be beleeved, as impoſſible to be expreſt; They have perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted poore Chriſtians with fire and water with fire to conſume their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and bones to aſhes; With water, to conſume their very aſhes if it were poſſible to nothing.</p>
            <p>Of this the Church of <hi>France</hi> hath had moſt ſad and long experience. For the perſecutions of the Proteſtants in <hi>France;</hi> How many Edicts, Proſcriptions, Proclamations for their utter deſtruction are ſtill witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof? What combination of Princes? what Armies raiſed? Townes burnt? whole Countries depopulated? Witneſſe that of <hi>Merindol,</hi> and <hi>Chabriers:</hi> private murders, publick Maſſacres as that of <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein were moſt bloudily cut off very many thouſands? what cruelties have been exerciſed, for number incredible, for fury unſufferable, had they not been inſpired, and ſupported by the divine power; What lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring torments were invented, to make them dye piecemeale; <hi>ut ſentiant ſe mori;</hi> among many other, one is moſt memorable, of a Frier that tooke a poore Proteſtant, filled his bootes full of greaſe, ſet him upon a
<pb facs="tcp:113883:3"/> forme, with his legs hanging over a ſoft fire, and ſo broyled him to death, with many more, too tedious to mention here. And yet for all theſe cruell ſufferings they have kept the faith and obtained a good report; they have been bettered by it; like gold that comes the purer out of the fire, they have been the cleaner for winnowing, the clearer for ſcowring. <hi>Tortores niſi habeat Eccleſia, non haberet fidos Doctores;</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this Church, though it hath been under many cloudes, yet ſuch lights have ſtill broke out in it, that the world hath not ſeene the like. And as God hath ſtill moved the hearts of their Princes, to give them ſome intermiſſion of ſuffering, ſo now a permiſſion of doing, even to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble at <hi>Charenton</hi> for ſetling of that Religion, whereof their chiefe Princes are enemies: If God will reſtore his Temple, <hi>Cyrus</hi> a heathen King, ſhall grant a Commiſſion for building of it. In this Synod there are many things remarkable; firſt the goodneſſe of God in moving the hearts of the King and Queen Regent towards them. <hi>2.</hi> Their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty againe in their humble ſubmiſſion to their Soveraigne Princes, their obedience to them and praiers for them, though of a contrary Religion. In the Acts of this Synod; obſerve firſt their wiſdome, and moderation in Diſcipline. <hi>2.</hi> Their piety and purity in Doctrine; but our approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can adde nothing to their worth. If any ſhall queſtion what need of ſuch frequent Aſſemblies (as many there be that move ſuch questions) let him heare what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes; <hi>It is neceſſary that hereſies be amongſt us.</hi> Therefore as neceſſary are often Aſſemblies of Paſtours of the Church. <hi>Neceſſitatem hanc furor haereticus imponit;</hi> and this made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves call a Synod <hi>Acts 15..</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeemes two dangerous Sects were now like to trouble that Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom care is taken in this Synod <hi>viz.</hi> the Anabaptiſt and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent; The firſt the moſt peſtilent ſect, that ſprang up of late times, and could never catch many Diſciples in a cleare water, did not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trouble theſe ſtreams. But the reverend Paſtours have put in ſufficient caution againſt them both, and God grant their neighbours may follow their worthy preſident. Concerning differencies about matters of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, the moſt antient and true bond of unity is, not one diſcipline one ceremony one policy; but one God, one Faith, one Baptiſme, and ſo one Church. <hi>Una erit conſortio aeternitatis</hi> and <hi>ad colendum unum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um tota eſt inſtituta;</hi> God grant one thing more <hi>ſit una vinculo cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis;</hi> And that we may all keepe the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe the faults ought to bee corrected in the Church by the word of God, and according to the rule of charity, and that all are not grievous and ſcandalous, ſome being enormous, others leſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, ſome ſecret, others publike.</p>

That in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret faults of which the offender ſhall repent, they ſhall not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported unto the Conſiſtory, but onely thoſe which they cannot cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect by the firſt meanes, or which being publike, the Conſiſtory may take Cognizance of, and proceed to the correction of them, by fitting cenſures, weighing well the Acts with their circumſtances, to the end they may apply thereunto, according to the exigent of the caſe, fitting cenſures, in ſuch manner as it ſhall bee expedient to draw the ſinner to repentance, who to this end may by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Conſiſtory, be for a time deprived or kept back, from the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And if there be need the more to humble him, he may be finally Excommunicated, and cut off from the body of the Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order before expreſſed, and declared, eſpecially if hee ſhew himſelfe rebellious unto the holy admonitions and cenſures which ſhall be made unto him, and continue obſtinate and altogether impenitent.</p>

                  <p>But as for them which have been admoniſhed divers times of their offences, and yet ſhew themſelves diſobedient unto the Conſiſtory, as alſo they which ſhall have committed any great and enormous crimes, which are puniſhable by the Magiſtrate, and which may bring publike ſcandall unto the Church, they ſhall be puniſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſort of Cenſures.</p>

In that therefore hee doth admoniſh us to humble our ſelves, and to be diſpleaſed in our ſelves, and by that meanes he doth prepare us, to deſire and crave his grace, by which all the perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and curſedneſſe of our firſt nature may bee aboliſhed: for wee are not capable to receive it, except wee be firſt emptied of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of our owne vertue, wiſdome and juſtice, unto a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of all that is in us.</p>
            <p>Now when hee doth put us in mind of our miſery, hee doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe comfort us by his mercy, promiſing to regenerate us by his holy Spirit unto newneſſe of life, which may be to us an entrance into his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This regeneration doth conſiſt in two parts: firſt, we muſt renounce to our ſelves, not following our owne reaſon, pleaſure, and will; but captivating our underſtanding and heart, to the wiſdome and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, mortifying all that is ours, and of our fleſh: Then we muſt follow the light of God to obey &amp; ſubmit to his good pleaſure, which he doth ſhew unto us in his Word, and to which hee doth lead us by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>The accompliſhment both of the one and of the other, is in our Saviour JESUS, whoſe death and paſſion hath ſuch vertue, that partaking of it, we are as it were buried to ſinne, to the end that our carnall concupiſcence may be mortified in us.</p>
            <p>In like manner by the vertue of his Reſurrection, wee riſe unto newneſſe of life, which is from God, in that his Spirit doth lead and governe us, to produce in us ſuch workes as may bee acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, the firſt and principall point of our ſalvation is, that by his mercy he doth forgive us all our ſinnes, not imputing them to us but blotting the memory of them, that they may not bee reckoned unto us, when we ſhall appeare before him to be judged.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:113883:47"/>
            <p>All theſe graces are conferred upon us, when he is pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate us into his Church by Baptiſme, for by this Sacrament hee doth teſtifie unto us the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and for this cauſe he hath inſtituted the Signe of Water, to figure unto us, that as by this Element all corporall filthineſſe is cleanſed, ſo he will waſh and purifie our ſoules, that no further ſpot or ſtaine may appeare; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it doth repreſent unto us our renewing, which as wee ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth conſiſt in the mortification of our fleſh, and that ſpirituall life which he doth produce in us.</p>
            <p>So wee receive a double grace and benefit from G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in Baptiſme, provided that wee doe not voyd the vertue of this Sacrament by our ingratitude, firſt we have a certaine aſſurance that God will bee a propitious Father unto us, not imputing to us our ſinnes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Secondly, that he will aſſiſt us by his holy Spirit that wee may be able to fight againſt the diuell, ſinne, and the concupiſcence of our fleſh unto victory, that we may live in the liberty of his kingdome, which is a kingdome of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Since then theſe two things are in us accompliſhed by the Grace of JESUS Chriſt; It will follow that the vertue and ſubſtance of Baptiſme is compriſed in him: and in very deed we have no other waſhing; but by his blood nor no other renewing then in his Death and Reſurrection: but as he doth communicate unto us his riches, and his bleſſings by his Word; ſo he doth diſtribute the ſame by his Sacraments.

            <p n="3">3. Accidents. <hi>Caſus fortuiti.</hi> As when a man travelling with money to pay his debts, falls into the hands of Theeves, whereby he is enforced to fotfeit his ſecurity. Yet in this caſe the Common Law-Courts may give a remedy, and doe. Nor doth it appeare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113883:53"/> what grounds in Law the Lord Keeper hath Conuſans of theſe three recited points.</p>
            <p>But now if a man have but communication of a Bargaine with a litigious crafty perſon, he will by the help of that thing called Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cry it up for an abſolute Bargaine, and enforce the performance of it. Nay, contrary to the Statute, 4. H. 4. c. 23. this Court is grown to that boldneſſe, as to examine Judgements given in the Kings Courts (though anciently the Kings Bench did reverſe Errours of the Chancery) whereby ſuits are revived, and have more then one life, and become almoſt immortall: What ſute of Buffe laſteth halfe ſo long? Nay, the ſutes which the children of Iſrael wore in their forty years peregrination thorow the wilderneſſe, were of no dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe in compariſon.</p>
            <p>This Examination of buſineſſes after judgement at the Common-Law was countenanced by K. <hi>James</hi> in the yeare 1614. who affecting to weaken the power of the Lawes, and to have all Lawes <hi>in ſcrinio pectoris,</hi> within his owne and his Lord-Keepers breſt (whom he can diſplace at pleaſure) knew that the frequent uſe of equity in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery was a more hidden and powerfull way to undermine our Lawes, and bring all our Rights and Properties under an arbitrary power, then his boyſterous Prerogative Royall; freer from envy, and fitter to exſtinguiſh common concord, and to divide Families by multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Suits, which all immoderate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſire, their rule being, <hi>Divide &amp; impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> And this is<note n="*" place="margin">Hiſt.

            <p>There happeneth rarely in the Civill Law a doubtfull caſe, called, <hi>Caſus pro amico,</hi> A caſe to pleaſure a friend withall; when (upon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing the caſe) the arguments upon both ſides are of ſuch equall weight, that neither by anything ſpoken in pleading, nor by any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or reaſons from his owne knowledge, the Judge can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſcerne to which ſide the Ballance of Juſtice inclines: in this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity the Judge (without wronging his conſcience, not being able to judge upon the merits of the <hi>Cauſe</hi>) may judge according to the merits of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> he may give it to the poorer by way of charity: or to the worthier by way of reward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For our Law, it cannot be over throwne but by it ſelfe, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the injurious wit of a Lawyer, to miſconſtrue and betray it. Theſe Sonnes of the Law have turned juſtice into wormwood: the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable profeſſion of the Law <hi>in artem litigandi,</hi> into the trade of brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and pettifogging.

            <p>They are <hi>Crumeni-mulga natio, loquuteleia turba;</hi> A purſe-milking generation, and a prating Rabble. I ſpeake not theſe things againſt the Profeſſion, nor againſt all the Profeſſors, amongſt whom I know are many worthy of reſpect for their abilities and integrities, I ſpeake onely againſt the common Traders of the Law, <hi>vulgus Iuriſperitorums.</hi> Of theſe I may ſay, that the houſe of a crafty Lawyer or Atturney keeps the Countrey in awe, and drawes in contribution as farre as an ordinary Garriſon. And (cuſtome being growne into a ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) it is as naturall for a poor countrey-man to feare one of theſe as for a Larke to feare a Hobby. Having thus prepared your minde, to receive good councell, I will now give it you without Fee or Bribe.</p>
            <p>Take heed how you fill up Elections with theſe kinde of men: the Recorder of every Borough will of courſe looke to be choſen, as being the mouth of his Corporation. But it is a Cuſtome not fit for the neceſſity of theſe times, our affaires require rather States-men then Lawyers: My reaſon againſt ſuch Elections follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The knowledge of the Common-Law, doth no way conduce to the making of a States-man: It is a confined and topicall kinde of Learning, calculated onely for the Meridian of Weſtminſter-Hall, and reacheth no further then Dover. Tranſplant a Common Lawyer to Calice, and his head is no more uſefull there than a Sun-Dyall in a grave: who ever heard of the Politikes written in Law-French?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the making and penning of good Lawes were the worke of theſe times (as they are not) it were not wiſdome to chooſe merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Lawyers to make Lawes: becauſe they are the firſt men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſubtilities to evade them, and make them uſeleſſe; and will pen them obſcurely on purpoſe, to make themſelves work in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:113883:54"/>3. Lawyers, being a bold and talkative kind of men, will intrude themſelves into the Chaires in all Committees, where (being accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to take Fees) they will under-hand protect Delinquents, and their concealed Eſtates with tricks and devices.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Reformation of Courts of Juſtice is a work of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, without it (though the ſword of the Lord returne againe into its ſcabbard, ſo that you have no warre) you ſhall have no peace. But if you have many Lawyers, they will never ſuffer any effectuall Law to paſſe, for this purpoſe: Becauſe they get more by the corruption and delayes of the Law, than by the Law it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It it neceſſary to make a Law for imitation of exorbitant Fees, extortion and prevarication amongſt Lawyers, as is uſed in other Countries.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is neceſſary to limit the certain number of practiſers in each Court, that they ſwarme not (like Loc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Was ever ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a wound given to your Lawes, Liberties, and Properties, as the predetermined judgement of Ship-money? Who gave that blow? Judges. What were they? theeves, <hi>Cum Prewilegio Regiae Majeſtatis;</hi> who bought Juſtice by whole ſale, and ſold it by retaile: who aſſiſted them? Lawyers, who undertaking to plead for their Clients againſt it, prevaricated (for the moſt part) and betrayed the cauſe; to get favour and preferment. And yet ſuch proceedings were againſt both the Judges, and the Coronation Oath: And the Judges as well as the King have the Coronation Oath in keeping; <hi>Treſilian</hi> and his fellow Judges were condemned and executed in <hi>Richard</hi> the ſeconds time, for making the King breake his Coronation Oath, upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudiciall opinion colluſorily given: for (ſaith the Record) <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Domini Regis erga populum ſuum habent ad cuſtodiendum.</hi> But our Judges (though more wicked) have the happineſſe to live in a more wicked age <hi>(cujus pars magna ſunt)</hi> and out-live their Crimes, paying only a ſmall part by way of Fine, enjoying the reſt of their ſtollen Treaſure: <hi>Occulta ſpolia &amp; pluros de pace triumphos.</hi> After they had made Peace as devouring as Warre, and the Law as cruell as the

               <hi>Verres</hi> (being Pro-Conſull of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>) had pilled that Province (and other Pro-Conſulls, and Pro-Pretors, were puniſhed for leſſer extortions) he laughing at their fooliſh moderation, vaunted to his Broker <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchides,</hi> that hee had gotten enough to buy the friend-ſhip of the Senate, and come off a rich and honourable man: So our Judges en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their crimes, and the price and reward of them.

But through whoſe favour is it, they have not expiated their crimes with their bloud, and waſhed away the guilt of the Land, but the Lawyers? who wiſely conſider, it may be their own caſe another day.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed you how unſafe it is to truſt mercenary men with <hi>making</hi> or <hi>keeping</hi> of your Lawes, I will epitomize what I have ſaid in<note n="*" place="margin">Panigyr. ad Trajanum.</note>
